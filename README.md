# RemoteControlApp
There are two separate projects in this repository, ionic-tabs-lights (ionic mobile application) and ESP8266_cloud_test (embedded arduino application).  They are meant to work together to allow the client application to control an I/O pin on an ESP8266 arduino device (or with proper configuration, any WiFi enabled arduino device). This is made possible through the [aREST project](https://arest.io/)
